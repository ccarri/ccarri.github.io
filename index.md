### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, Part 1, was one of my favorite projects to work on because it was interesting to see how a mathematical equation could be applied in code. I was able to define two functions that would use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate the user's BMR given their height, weight, and age through main. The two functions would return two versions of the BMR, one for men and the other for women.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 1, was another of my favorites because it was a bit trickier to work on since it involved creating many conditions based on some parking rule signs. I was able to use the boolean operators in the conditions of if statements inside the correct parking function. The boolean operators would help find the correct day, hour, and minute from the parking rules. The parking functions would check to see if the data from the user is within the conditions of the if statements, and the output would be either true or false for available parking at the location.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2, is another project I enjoyed working on because it similarly uses the process of knitting to create a nice pattern of keyboard characters. Using for loops, I was able to make a pattern by looping and printing certain keyboard characters a number of times on each line. To make a certain pattern, I had to use an outer loop and two inner loops. The outer loop would print once per line, and the inner loops would print the characters a number of times on the line based on the range in the outer for loop.
